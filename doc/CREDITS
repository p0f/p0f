  William Stearns did lots of work that made v1 successful.
  He does not have any direct contributions to v2 yet, but I hope this will
  change, until then, this is a honorary mention.

  We apologize all of you who should be listed here, but are not. If you
  feel this is the case, please let us know and we will fix this
  unintentional omission.

  A countless number of people contributed fingerprints via p0f-help website
  (ok, more precisely: thousands). Most of them did not provide their
  names, or requested not to be credited. For those who did, I simply couldn't 
  keep up maintaining the list, and had a hard time deciding who should be 
  credited and who shouldn't. Duplicates, the sheer amount of information 
  provided, data reliability issues... I would still like to recognize
  people who have contributed a number of signatures, provided some
  rare fingerprints, or otherwise made a considerable contribution to the
  database. If you feel you should be listed here, please let me know.
